Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the solar cycle. However, since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.

Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures. Examples of greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide and methane. These emissions come primarily from energy use, industry, transport, agriculture, and buildings.

Impacts of climate change are already being felt across the globe. Glaciers are shrinking, sea levels are rising, and extreme weather events like wildfires, droughts, and hurricanes are becoming more intense and frequent. Low-lying coastal areas are especially vulnerable to flooding.

To mitigate climate change, reducing greenhouse gas emissions is critical. This involves transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power, improving energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable land use and transportation.

Climate adaptation is equally important. This includes building infrastructure to withstand extreme weather, creating early warning systems, and protecting ecosystems that provide natural buffers, like wetlands and forests.

The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, is a global treaty that aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C, ideally 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. Countries commit to reducing emissions and reporting their progress.

Each individual can also help by reducing energy use, supporting clean technologies, and spreading awareness of climate issues. Collective action—from governments, businesses, and citizens—is necessary to confront one of the biggest challenges of our time.
